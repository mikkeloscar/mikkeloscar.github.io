      Maze is an automated build system for Archlinux packages. It's currently
      in the early stages and supports automatic builds of AUR packages.
      Eventually it will also support building of custom PKGBUILDs as well as
      packages from ABS. It will also gain support for rebuilding a set of
      packages for instance when required because of ABI changes in gcc etc.
