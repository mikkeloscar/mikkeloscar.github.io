    Richard hails from Tulsa. He has earned degrees from the University of
    Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!) Before starting Pied
    Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer. While his work
    focuses on applied information theory, mostly optimizing lossless
    compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants, his
    non-work interests range widely, everything from quantum computing to chaos
    theory. He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited”
    conversation!
